Did this assignment solo; I wrote this in the notebook but also putting here: overall, I'm pretty impressed with the autoencoder's accuracy, but I don't really know if it tells me very much about the PLAsTiCC data because the interpolation and structuring of my data feels like such an abstraction away from the original dataset. Also, I apparently am very bad at picking features for random forests.
